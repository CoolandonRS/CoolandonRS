Hi, I'm CoolandonRS. A strange pineapple that found its way onto the internet, and unfortunately has stayed there since.<br/><br/>
My repositories are an amalgam of whatever I felt like making at the time, and [sudokey](https://github.com/coolandonrs/sudokey) and [dynknock](https://github.com/coolandonrs/dynknock) are my current favorites in this collection.

Ny favorite languages are Swift and C#. You'll notice there's not a lot of swift here, and thats because, despite my wishes, Swift doesn't exist on much other then macOS.<br/><br/>
The Java is only there for minecraft mods and the unfortunate time before I learned of C#, if you were wondering. I don't like it much. Nor do I like python or javascript, and I <b><i>will</i></b> fight you on that.
